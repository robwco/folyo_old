				/ “Finding the right designer just takes too much time!”
				“Why is finding the right designer so hard!?”
			%p Ever had that thought? The truth is that <strong>looking for a designer sucks</strong>. Most of the designers you come across will be:
			/ %img.illustration{:src => "/assets/new/illustration1.png"}
			%ul.items.cross
				%li Inexperienced
				%li Not available
				%li Not Interested
				%li Too expensive
			%p Every hour spent looking at design portfolios is time that you could be working on your product instead. So why not speed things up a little?
			/ %p And even if you <em>do</em> find someone good, there's no guarantee that they’ll be available or interested in your project.
		.block
			%h2 Receive a shortlist of recommended designers…
			%p Give Folyo a try. We’ll send your project to our community of vetted freelance designers, and give you a shortlist of designers who are:
			/ %img.illustration{:src => "/assets/new/illustration2.png"}
			%ul.items.check
				%li Pre-vetted
				%li Available now
				%li Interested
				%li Within Budget
		.block
			%h2 …and we'll help you pick the best
			%p Once you get enough replies, we'll also help suggest the best fit. It's like having a design agency in your corner, but without the hefty commission!
