      Here's a tip: if you're not sure about a budget, just enter the **minimum amount** you'd consider.

      For example, you might know that no matter what you'd charge *at least* $1500 for a set of 30 icons.

  = render layout: '/surveys/partials/form_block' do
    = render '/surveys/partials/project', project: skill[:project_types][:illustration]
    = render '/surveys/partials/budget', input_name: :illustration_budget, input_label: 'How much would you charge for a similar project?', f:f

  = render layout: '/surveys/partials/form_block' do
    = render '/surveys/partials/project', project: skill[:project_types][:icon_design]
    = render '/surveys/partials/budget', input_name: :icon_design_budget, input_label: 'How much would you charge for a similar project?', f:f

  = render '/surveys/partials/pagination', {current_page: 3, position: 'bottom'}
